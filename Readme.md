**Instructions to run the game using terminal:**

- make
- ./TarzanSwing


**Controls of the game:**

- Press and hold left mouse button to draw a rope from main object to the object near to the click.
As long as user holds on to the left button rope will remain attached to that object and object will swing in cirular motion around that hook.

- Release the left mouse button to detach the rope from the object.
As soon as user releases the left mouse button rope detaches from that object, main object leaves circular motion and falls under the affect of gravity,
with conservation of momentum.



**Game Features:**

- Game starts with main object freely falling under the affect of gravity.
- User presses and holds left mouse button and main object attaches to the object near to the click by a rope, and does circular motion around it.
- If user releases the mouse button, rope gets detached and main object falls under the affect of gravity with conservation of momentum applied.

- If main object collides with red enemy object or lava, main object dies and game ends.
- If main object collides with white friendly objects, main object gains points and total score increases.

- In the end menu if the user presses retry, the game reinitiates, if the user presses exit, the game ends.
- In the main menu if the user presses Play, the game starts, if the user presses exit, the game ends.


The game uses Vector Calculus to apply:
 Newtons laws of motion
 Conservation of momentum
 Circular Motion

The game has text rendering, visual and sound effects.
